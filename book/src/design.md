# Design

This section is about the design of yuubind, some parts internal as
well as some that may have an impact on regular use cases. Nothing
here should be required for properly configuring a yuubind instance,
but it should help understanding why some design choices were made.

If you find something of practical impact that is not well-explained
enough in the rest of the book, and had to resort to this section to
properly use yuubind, this is a documentation issue — please open an
issue about that!

And, on the other hand, if there is an aspect of the design of yuubind
that you do not understand, it probably should have an answer in this
section.
