# kannader

Kannader is a SMTP server designed from the ground up with the intention of
being both highly configurable and secure-by-default.

This crate is part of the ecosystem of crates developed to support it. It is
still possible to use it for other use cases, but the one it was designed for is
kannader.

## Licensing

In this repository, there is code that can be governed by one or more
of the MIT, Apache 2.0 and AGPLv3 licenses. Overall, the idea is that
library crates are dual-licensed under the MIT and Apache 2.0
licenses, and that the binaries as well as configuration code are
licensed under the AGPLv3 licenses.

You can know which license applies to a particular piece of code by
looking at what its corresponding `Cargo.toml` file specifies. If no
corresponding `Cargo.toml` file can be found, then the license is
AGPLv3.

If the AGPLv3 license is a problem for you or your business, feel free
to contact us and there will most certainly be a way to work this
through.
