This provides us a path to evolve WASI by allowing the same WASI Command to import functions from different snapshots - e.g. the user could use Rust’s `std` which imports snapshot 1, but also depend directly on the `wasi` crate which imports some future snapshot 2. Right now, this amounts to supporting snapshot 1 and “snapshot 0” aka wasi_unstable at once."],["table",""]],"struct":[["Error","The `Error` type, a wrapper around a dynamic error type."],["WasiCtx",""]],"trait":[["Context","Provides the `context` method for `Result`."],["ErrorExt",""],["RngCore","The core of a random number generator."]]});
